# Corne_Keyboard

A Free_for_all Corne-Inspired Repo for anyone wanting to build there first corne keyboard on a budget (or just anyone wanting to see a different take on the same)

It will be running on KMK for firmware control:
  + This is because I found it easier to flask KMK on an RP2040 based microcontroller
  + Also:
    + The programs are written in Python; hence easy to understand and modify
    - The pins used don't really matter, since they are defined in the code (That saved me from a major headache)
    - The use and related examples are well documented on there github page: https://github.com/KMKfw

I'll include links in the documentation as we go on
The build I use for this is hand wired (Don't worry, it's not that hard and also cheaoer than ordering a PCB(In my country at least))

Parts for the build:
  + Case: 3D printed
    - files on the Printables website; for [instance](https://www.printables.com/model/347524)
  + Microcontroller:
    - YD-RP2040 Development Board (4MB Flash Raspberry Pi PICO * 2)
  + Cables:
    - TRRS Cable ;(4-Pin Aux)
    - Type-C to Type-C (/USB-A) cable
  + Other:
    - MX Switches and MX-Compatible keycaps(Remember to make sure that you pic keycaps compatible with your switches)
    - Diodes IN4148
